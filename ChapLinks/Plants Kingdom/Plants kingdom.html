    <h1><b>Plants Kingdom</b></h1>
    <p>Virtually all other living creatures depend on plants to survive. Through photosynthesis,
        plants convert energy from sunlight into food stored as carbohydrates. Because animals
        cannot get energy directly from the sun, they must eat plants (or other animals that have
        had a vegetarian meal) to survive. Plants also provide the oxygen humans and animals breathe
        , because plants use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen into the
        atmosphere.</p>
    <p> Plants Kingdom is divided into two categories</p>
    <ul>
       <li><a href="#spore">Spore Bearing Plants</a></li>
       <li><a href="#seed">Seed Bearing Plants</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="spore">Spore Bearing Plants</h2>
    <p>
        For the purposes of this intro course we will consider three
        informal groups of plants,
        distinguished from each other by their modes of reproduction.
        The simplest are those
        vascular plants that reproduce with spores.  This actually
        includes four formal taxa
        ("divisions", which are the plant equivalent of "phyla").
        The simplest spore-bearers are
        called "psilophytes".  They have only green stems and spore
        cases -- no leaves, no roots.
        They live in water.  Fossils are as nondescript as the recent
        ones.
        Somewhat more complex are the horsetails or Equisetophyta
        (or Sphenophyta).  These have
        distinctively ribbed green stems with spore cases at the
        end, and they have true roots,
        allowing them to live out of water.  There are tiny scale-like
        leaves only at the stem joints.
        Modern forms are rather small, as can be seen from the picture
        below, but tree-sized forms 10's
        of meters in height were common in the Paleozoic.  They are easily
        recognized as equisetophytes
        by their ribbed stems that reach many cm in diameter.  The picture
        is Equisetum arvense photographed
        near Franklin, WV.  The lens cap is ~4.5 cm in diameter.

    <h2 id="seed">Seed Bearing Plant</h2>
    <p>A seed bearing plant is a plant that produces seeds.
        The gymnosperms and the angiosperms together
        form the seed-bearing plants. The seed-bearing plants
        have been an enormously successful group in
        the history of life, owing to the evolution of seeds
        and pollen. The seed is a superior unit of
        dispersal to the naked spore, since it includes a food
        reserve and, among angiosperms, a protective
        layer.
        eed bearing plants make up the majority of species
        within the plant kingdom with as many as 274,000
        varieties, according to Kimball's Biology Pages.
        These plants represent the latest developments within
        plant evolution processes. Both flowering and nonflowering
        plants fall within the seed bearing category,
        which includes gymnosperm and angiosperm classifications.
        Early forms of plant life appeared short in stature
        compared to the numerous varieties of plants in
        existence today. Part of the reason for their small
        sizes had to do with the type of tissue that made up
        the plant body, according to Biology Reference,
        a science-information reference website. Seed bearing
        plants consist of vascular tissue, which has built-in
        water and nutrient-conducting passageways.
        The development of vascular tissue enabled plants to adapt
        to land-soil environments as opposed to the
        water-based environments needed by nonvascular plant forms,
        according to Estrella Mountain Community College
        The development of vascular tissue also gave rise to the
        formation of stems, leaves, flowers and seeds within
        the plant body.
